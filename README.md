# LifeboatSurvivalMode
This is a pmmp plugin that generates random chests with the loot you choose around a world. Just like Lifeboat's sm.

## How to use it
Using it is fairly simple, download the lastest release and then move it to your plugins folder. Then start your server and stop it again. Open the config.yml file that should've appeared in plugin_data/LifeboatSurvivalMode and then edit it according to what you want. 
Example configuration:
```yml
spawn_interval: 10 # in seconds
maximum_chests: 10
maximum_items_per_chest: 9
worlds:
  - name: world
    max_z: 500
    min_z: 0
    max_x: 500
    min_x: 0
  - name: secondworld
    max_z: 1000
    min_z: -100
    max_x: 500
    min_x: -100
```
After that, you can also edit the items.yml file to fit your requirements.
Example items.yml file:
```yml
items:
  - "4:0:32" # formay: itemid:itemdata:quantity     nice website for ids: https://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/
  - "1:0:64"
  - "264:0:1"
  - "280:0:3"
  - "320:0:5"
  - "366:0:4"
  - "351:4:4"
  - "265:0:2"
```
    
## Troubleshooting
If the plugin is not working make sure that you are within the radius that you have chosen x and z wise and make sure that those chunks are loaded.
